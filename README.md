Project cloning tutorial to local machine:

	1- Install git on your machine --> https://git-scm.com/downloads

	2- Open up your "git cmd" (or just command prompt) on windows and set up git --> git config --global user.email "email@example.com" and --> git config --global user.name "Black Panther"
		--> Only need to do this step once at the beginning when you just downloaded git (setting up)

	3- Go to a directory of your choice using the command 'cd' ex: cd Desktop/

	4- Write this on your terminal to get the repo on your machine --> git clone https://github.com/jeffreytang97/Overwatch.git
